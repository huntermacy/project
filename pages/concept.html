      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Functions: Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. Use them to encapsulate and separate different parts of your code that perform specific tasks. This allows you to reuse code and makes it easier to reason about.</li>
          <li>Use Classes and Objects: Classes and objects allow you to create reusable code that can be used in different parts of your application. They also help in creating an abstraction layer over your code, making it more modular and easier to maintain.</li>
          <li>Use Namespaces: Namespaces are a way to organize your code by creating a container that holds related functions and variables. This helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to maintain your code.</li>
          <li>Use Modules: Modules are a way to encapsulate related functionality into a separate file or directory. This allows you to reuse code across different parts of your application and makes it easier to manage dependencies.</li>
          <li>Use Comments: Comments are an essential part of any codebase. Use them to document your code and explain how different parts of your code work. This helps to make your code more understandable and maintainable.</li>
