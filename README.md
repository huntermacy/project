Questions to Study:

1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

2. How do you handle errors in JavaScript applications?

- Try/Catch blocks
- Error objects (error.name, error.message, error.stack)
- Custom functions
- React error boundaries

3. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.npm

- A closure is a feature in JavaScript that allows functions to access variables that are declared outside of their own scope.
- Closures are useful for a variety of tasks, inlcuding creating private variables and functions, implementing data hiding, and managing state in asynchronous operations. By using closures, we can write more modular and maintainable code in JavaScript.
